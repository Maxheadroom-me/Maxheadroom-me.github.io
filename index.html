            <div class="aboutme">
                <p class="paragraphGap">I started writing when I was 14 yrs old. I enjoyed fantasy and science fiction books and started many but finished no Novels. In university where I did physics I had some short stories published in the local rags but nothing spectacular, though the stories I was very proud of.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphGap">After a mixed career where I let life overtake my passion I finally found time and commitment and career change (thatâ€™s really where the time came from) to turn my energy back to writing and after a colleague asked me about writing I wrote a chapter of a new book and suddenly I found myself finding time to continue what was actually just a faint idea.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphGap">So far I am up to chapter 8 of my new book. I find myself getting immersed in a story which starts mundane and develops into a new concept of Sci Fi.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphGap">Apart from my daughter who is my equal passion, I play badminton and turn my hand to web development and psychology with a smattering of sign language.</p>
